Contextify is a Gemini-powered English language learning tool that helps users understand text in context. With the Chrome extension, users can select any text and receive a succinct definition and interpretation.

## Why we need this

When learning a language, you want immersion—you want to read and
consume as much content as you can with the minimum amount of
interruptions. Traditional methods require you to stop reading, look up
words, write them down, and make flashcards. This means spending way too
much time "studying English" instead of "using English"—and that's the
wrong approach.

Existing instant definition tools often fail because they don't
understand the context the words are being used in.

Contextify remedies this issue by leveraging the power of Google's
Gemini AI. You can read and at the same time learn unfamiliar vocabulary
with appropriate learning feedback without breaking the flow of your
reading. Whether you're an international student learning English or
someone exploring different languages, you no longer have to choose
between immersion and understanding.
